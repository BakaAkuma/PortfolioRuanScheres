## About me
My name is **Ruan Scheres**, I am currently a first-year student at the *Breda University of Applied Sciences*. I am enrolled in the *Creative Media and Game Technologies* where I follow the games programming discipline.

This program follows a **project-based** learning approach which leaves me with a lot of projects which show my growth as a developer while attending this school. Because of this I decided to setup a portfolio page where anyone who is interested can look at these projects.

## Hill Raider

**Hill Raider** is my intake project for the study which I am currently following. The goal of the game is to collect as much food as you can before while trying to stay alive inside of an enemy ant colony. While the game itself was quite simple, it was the second game project I ever worked on and it taught me a lot about game concepts I was not very familiar with. These concepts include:
* Designing a game from scratch
* Enemy AI
* Collision handling

## Proto-Type

**Proto-Type** is the second project I had to make for my first year. For this project I had to re-create some mechanics from the arcade shoot them up game *R-Type* within 6 weeks. Some of the concepts featured in this project are the following:
* Tile maps
* Screen space scrolling
* Basic maths for 2D games
* Efficient Collison detection
* Gameplay programming
